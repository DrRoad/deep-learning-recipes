# deep-learning-recipes

R implementation for selected machine learning methods with deep learning frameworks (Keras, Tensorflow).

The code here is mostly from my blog posts.

Principles: clean, self-contained, minimal dependency, works with the latest framework versions.

- Matrix factorization for binary implicit feedback data. [[blog post](https://nanx.me/blog/post/recsys-binary-implicit-feedback-r-keras/)] [[code](recsys-binary-implicit-keras.R)]
- "Wide and deep" model for regression/classification. [[blog post](https://nanx.me/blog/post/building-my-first-deep-learning-machine/)] [[code](tensorflow-wide-n-deep.R)]
